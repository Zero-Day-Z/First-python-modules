My first python modules 

I created my first python modules, and converted the modules to json. 

Modules created:
Grandfather
Father
Son

Included variables for each persons name and DOB.
Created a method to calculate age.

Imported modules into the main program and print the name and age.
Convert each person into JSON and print out the JSON for each Person.
